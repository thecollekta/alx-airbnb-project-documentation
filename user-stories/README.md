# User Stories - Airbnb Clone Backend

## Overview

This directory contains the user stories documentation for the Airbnb Clone backend project. The user stories are derived from the comprehensive use case diagram and represent the functional requirements from the user's perspective.

## Purpose

User stories serve as the bridge between high-level requirements and actual implementation, providing:

* Clear understanding of user needs and expectations
* Acceptance criteria for testing and validation
* Prioritization framework for development planning
* Communication tool between stakeholders and development team

## Documentation Structure

### Files in this Directory

* **`user-stories.md`** - Comprehensive user stories document containing:
  * 19 detailed user stories covering all major system functionality
  * Acceptance criteria for each story
  * Priority levels and story point estimates
  * Implementation notes following Django best practices
  * Traceability matrix linking stories to use cases

## User Story Format

Each user story follows the standard Agile format:

```text
As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].
```

### Story Components

1. **Title** - Descriptive name for the story
2. **Description** - User story in standard format
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - Specific conditions for story completion
4. **Priority** - High/Medium/Low based on business value
5. **Story Points** - Effort estimation using Fibonacci sequence
6. **Epic** - Grouping of related stories
7. **Django Implementation** - Technical implementation notes

## Epic Categories

The user stories are organized into 8 main epics:

1. **User Management** (18 story points)
   * Registration, authentication, profile management
2. **Property Management** (21 story points)
   * Listing creation, availability management
3. **Search & Discovery** (21 story points)
   * Property search, filtering, detailed viewing
4. **Booking Management** (33 story points)
   * Booking requests, approval process, modifications
5. **Payment Processing** (23 story points)
   * Secure payments, host payouts
6. **Reviews & Ratings** (13 story points)
   * Review submission, response system
7. **Communication** (21 story points)
   * Messaging, notifications
8. **Administration** (36 story points)
   * User management, content moderation, analytics

## Release Planning

### Release 1 (MVP) - 67 Story Points

Core functionality enabling basic platform operations:

* User registration and authentication
* Property listing and search
* Booking creation and payment processing

### Release 2 - 54 Story Points

Enhanced features for improved user experience:

* Profile management and availability control
* Booking approval workflow
* Review system and messaging

### Release 3 - 59 Story Points

Advanced features for platform maturity:

* Booking modifications and review responses
* Comprehensive notification system
* Administrative tools and analytics

## Implementation Guidelines

### Django Best Practices Applied

1. **Model Design**
   * Single responsibility principle for each model
   * Proper use of relationships and constraints
   * Strategic indexing for performance
2. **API Design**
   * RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
   * Versioning strategy (`/api/v1/`)
   * Comprehensive input validation
3. **Security Implementation**
   * JWT authentication with refresh tokens
   * Role-based access control
   * Input sanitization and validation
4. **Performance Optimization**
   * Database query optimization
   * Caching strategies
   * Pagination for large datasets

### Code Quality Standards

* **Ruff** compliance for code formatting and linting
* **Type hints** for better code documentation
* **Comprehensive testing** for each user story
* **API documentation** using OpenAPI/Swagger

## Traceability

Each user story is mapped to specific use cases from the use case diagram, ensuring:

* Complete coverage of system functionality
* Clear relationship between requirements and implementation
* Ability to track changes and updates

## Usage Instructions

1. **For Product Owners** : Use stories to understand feature scope and business value
2. **For Developers** : Implement features based on acceptance criteria
3. **For Testers** : Create test cases from acceptance criteria
4. **For Stakeholders** : Track progress and understand development priorities

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

* Unit tests for individual story components
* Integration tests for cross-story workflows
* User acceptance tests based on story criteria
* Performance tests for high-load scenarios

### Definition of Done

A user story is considered complete when:

* All acceptance criteria are met
* Code follows Django best practices
* Unit and integration tests pass
* API documentation is updated
* Code review is completed

* **Use Case Diagram** : `../use-case-diagram/README.md`
* **Technical Specifications** : Links to technical documentation
* **API Documentation** : Generated from code comments

## Maintenance

This document should be updated when:

* New user stories are identified
* Existing stories are modified or refined
* Priority levels change based on business needs
* Implementation approaches are updated
